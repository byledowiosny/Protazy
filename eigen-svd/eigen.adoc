Eigen is a C++ template library for linear algebra, part of the KDE project 
(http://eigen.tuxfamily.org).

Types of matrices and vectors available:
– Dense and sparse matrices and vectors;
– Plain matrices/vectors and abstract expressions;
– Triangular and diagonal matrices;
– Column-major (the default) and row-major matrix storage.

Linear algebra operations available:
– Triangular, SVD, Cholesky, QR and LU solvers;
– Eigen values/vectors solver for non-selfadjoint matrices;
– Hessemberg decomposition;
– Tridiagonal decomposition of a selfadjoint matrix.

Interface with other packages for sparse matrices: TAUCS, umfpack, cholmod and SuperLU.

Performance:
Very efficient, see benchmark: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Benchmark.

Portability (platforms and compilers supported) -
standard C++ 98, compatible with any compliant compiler such as:
– GCC, version 3.3 and newer;
– MSVC (Visual Studio), 2005 and newer;
– ICC, recent versions;
– MinGW, recent versions.

Installation: no dependency.

Miscellaneous:
– Templates supported;
– Todo includes: interface to Lapack and eigensolver in nonselfadjoint case;
– Examples of users:
KDE related projects such as screensavers, kgllib, kglengine2d, solidkreator, painting and image editing Avogadro, an open source advanced molecular editor VcgLib, C++ template library for the manipulation and processing of triangular and tetrahedral meshes MeshLab, for the processing
and editing of unstructured 3D triangular meshes and point cloud.
The Yujin Robot company uses Eigen for the navigation and arm control of their next generation robots (switched from blitz, ublas and tvmet).

Limitations:
– Sparse matrices and vectors still experimental.

Debian packages: libeigen2-dev, libeigen2-doc, libeigen3-dev, libeigen3-doc.
